    DDR00: `Calling all Lord of the Rings fans—this game is tailor-made for you. While it isn’t based on Tolkien’s epic saga, Dragon’s Dogma 2 lets you assemble your team as if you’re in Middle-earth. Even if you missed the first installment, you can dive straight into the sequel without any issues.
    If you haven’t already, I highly recommend watching the short series on Netflix. The anime is fantastic and provides a solid background to the story.
    Admittedly, I didn’t focus too much on the narrative while playing. The real highlight of the game lies in its action-packed sequences and expansive character creation.`,
    
    DDR01: `For the creatively inclined, the character creation process is a treasure trove of possibilities. While I didn’t spend extensive time on it, encountering pawns (AI companions created by other players) was a delightful experience. You can mix and match your pawns—be it wizards, rangers, mages, or elves—to suit your gameplay style.`,

    DDR02: `As you traverse the enormous open world, you’ll face flying griffins, dragons, cyclopes, and goblins lurking around every corner. The environment is brimming with action, ensuring there’s never a dull moment. Nighttime brings a new level of challenge, with zombies, ghosts, and goblins emerging from the darkness to ambush you without warning. Campfires provide a place to rest and recover, but beware: you can be attacked at any moment, forcing you to defend yourself.`,
