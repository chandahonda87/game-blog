    Let’s start the review with the graphics. My experience was on the PS5, and regardless of whether you choose fidelity or performance mode, the game looks and feels fantastic. `,
   
    CP01: `If you haven’t played CyberPunk 2077 yet, you’re in for a treat. First, watch the Cyberpunk anime series on Netflix. Next, enjoy the classics Akira and Ghost in the Shell. Finally, dive into the world of Cyberpunk 2077 and make sure to get the Phantom Liberty expansion.

    Let’s start the review with the graphics. My experience was on the PS5, and regardless of whether you choose fidelity or performance mode, the game looks and feels fantastic. This isn’t a technical review—I can’t speak to 1080p, 1440p, 4k, 30fps, or 60fps—but I can say that Night City’s neon lights at night are mesmerizing, with holograms floating and cars bustling with life. The desert area is a refreshing escape from city life, with realistic particle effects as you drift through the sandy terrain.`,

    CP02: `If you played The Witcher 3, you know that CD Projekt Red excels at intertwining main and side stories. The storytelling in CyberPunk 2077 rivals that of Hollywood, but it’s the extended length and exceptional writing of a video game that create a deeply engrossing connection with the characters, making it an experience every gamer should savor.`,

    CP03: `The graphics burst with life, and the game is filled with artwork and movie references that enrich the experience. Missions are meaningful and engaging, while character customization keeps the adventure fresh. With a vast array of clothing options, you can keep your character looking cool, but I’m more into the skill tree. You can build your character to suit your playstyle: become a stealthy ninja deflecting bullets with your sword, hack doors and eliminate enemies silently, or become a powerhouse blazing through anyone in your path. The customization options entice you to return and explore different builds, giving the game high replay value. The expansion is a 10/10 standalone game, and even after full completion, I was left wanting more. I’m excited for any new installments of CyberPunk 2077 and hope we get another one before the PS6.`
